# Facilities & Property Services Execution Intelligence

> **Status:** Concept / Phase‑0 Starter Repository
> **Purpose:** Second vertical expansion after BeautyOps AI

---

## 1. Overview

Facilities & Property Services Execution Intelligence (FPSEI) is an **AI‑powered execution intelligence platform** for organizations managing large portfolios of physical locations (retail, healthcare, hospitality, commercial real estate).

The system converts fragmented, unstructured operational data (inspection notes, work orders, photos, vendor updates) into:

* Standardized execution signals
* Site‑level risk scoring
* SLA and compliance visibility
* Cost and risk leakage insights

**Core thesis:**

> Facilities failures are not random — they are detectable, predictable execution breakdowns.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Multi‑site operators suffer from:

* Missed or incomplete inspections
* Vendor SLA breaches
* Inconsistent documentation
* Reactive maintenance cycles
* Poor visibility into site‑level risk

Despite significant spend on:

* CMMS tools
* Vendors and contractors
* Property management systems

Leadership still cannot reliably answer:

* *Which sites are most at risk right now?*
* *Where are we leaking money due to execution failure?*
* *Which vendors are underperforming?*

---

## 3. Product Definition

FPSEI is **not** a CMMS replacement.

It is an **execution intelligence layer** that sits above existing systems to:

* Normalize execution data
* Detect risk early
* Prioritize action
* Quantify financial impact

---

## 4. Target Users

### Primary Buyers

* Head of Facilities
* Director of Operations
* CFO / Finance Leadership

### Daily Users

* Facilities managers
* Regional ops leads
* Vendor managers

## 5. Core Entities (Data Model)

The platform reuses the BeautyOps execution schema with domain‑specific terminology:

| Core Entity      | Description                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Site             | Physical location (store, building, clinic, hotel) |
| Inspection       | Site visit, audit, or checklist event              |
| Work Order       | Maintenance or service task                        |
| Vendor           | External service provider                          |
| Execution Signal | Missed task, delay, violation, incomplete work     |
| Risk Score       | Aggregated execution risk per site                 |
| SLA              | Contractual performance threshold                  |

## 6. Phase‑Based Feature Roadmap

### Phase 0 — Data Credibility (Foundation)

**Goal:** Make execution data trustworthy and queryable

Features:

* Ingest inspection notes (text first)
* Normalize work order statuses
* Tag execution signals:

  * Missed inspections
  * Late work orders
  * Incomplete tasks
  * Documentation gaps
* Confidence scoring on extracted signals

---

### Phase 1 — Site Risk Visibility

**Goal:** Show leadership where execution is breaking down

Features:

* Site‑level execution risk score
* Ranked list of at‑risk sites
* Risk trend tracking over time
* Simple executive snapshot

---

### Phase 2 — Operational Enablement

**Goal:** Improve response speed and accountability

Features:

* AI‑generated site briefs
* Prioritized action lists
* Vendor follow‑up summaries
* Internal task recommendations

---

### Phase 3 — Financial & Compliance Intelligence

**Goal:** Tie execution to cost and risk

Features:

* SLA breach detection
* Cost leakage estimation
* Vendor performance benchmarking
* Audit‑ready reporting

---

## 7. Key Execution Signals (Facilities‑Specific)

* Missed inspections
* Delayed maintenance
* Repeat work orders
* Vendor no‑shows
* SLA violations
* Safety compliance gaps

---

## 8. Technology Stack

The platform mirrors the BeautyOps AI stack for maximum reuse:

### Backend

* **Python**
* **Pydantic AI** (agent orchestration & validation)
* **FastAPI** (API layer)
* **PostgreSQL / Supabase** (data + auth)

### AI / Intelligence

* OpenAI models for:

  * Note structuring
  * Risk scoring
  * Insight generation

### Frontend

* **React**
* **Vite**
* **Shadcn and tailwindcss

### Infrastructure

* Dockerized services
* Railway (backend)
* Vercel (frontend)

---

## 9. Monetization Strategy (Early)

* Per‑site pricing
* Tiered plans:

  * Visibility (risk + reporting)
  * Intelligence (recommendations + benchmarking)
* Paid pilots (30–60 days)

---

## 10. MVP Success Criteria

An MVP is successful when the system can:

* Rank sites by execution risk
* Identify previously unseen failures
* Quantify cost or risk exposure
* Support a paid pilot conversion

---

## 11. Strategic Positioning

**Internal positioning:**

> Execution intelligence, not facilities software.

**External positioning:**

> We show operators where execution is leaking money and increasing risk — before it becomes a crisis.

---

## 12. Relationship to BeautyOps AI

This vertical:

* Shares the same architecture
* Reuses the same AI pipelines
* Validates horizontal execution intelligence

BeautyOps proves the model in retail.

Facilities expands it into **cost, risk, and compliance‑driven operations**.

---

## 13. Next Steps

1. Clone core execution schema
2. Rename domain entities
3. Pilot with 1–2 multi‑site operators
4. Validate paid pilot demand
5. Expand vendor intelligence layer

---

## 15. Phase‑0 Engineering Task List (Execution Credibility)

> **Objective:** Establish a trustworthy execution‑intelligence foundation for Facilities & Property Services with minimal surface area.

This phase is about **data credibility**, not dashboards, automations, or integrations.
